				<p>Notes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A parser accepts a file when it reports no error, meaning it doesn't throw or, for the
						error-recovering parsers (oxc-parser, <code>tsc</code>, yuku-parser), returns no error
						diagnostic. The dimmed <code>−n</code> beside a percentage is the number of files
						rejected. A dimmed <code>100%</code> marks a parser that was used to select the source's
						files, so its 100% is by construction, not a result: svelte/compiler on the Svelte set
						and <code>tsc</code> on the TypeScript compiler's cases. The leading row leaves such a
						source out, so every parser there is measured on the same files and none by
						construction.
					</li>
					<li>
						Coverage has two blind spots. Accepting a file says nothing about producing the
						<em>right</em> AST; tsv's output is verified separately against the parsers it's a
						drop-in for (Svelte's parser, its <code>parseCss</code>, and acorn-typescript) at corpus
						scale in
						<a href="https://github.com/fuzdev/tsv/blob/main/docs/conformance_svelte.md">
							its repo's conformance gates
						</a>, and what it rejects among the TypeScript compiler's cases is catalogued in
						<a href="https://github.com/fuzdev/tsv/blob/main/docs/conformance_tsc.md">
							its tsc notes
						</a>. And coverage doesn't reward rejecting what should be rejected, so a permissive
						parser scores well here. tsv is permissive in this sense: it doesn't yet check most
						early errors, and rejects fewer than half of test262's should-reject parse tests
						(tracked in
						<a href="https://github.com/fuzdev/tsv/blob/main/docs/conformance_test262.md">
							its test262 notes
						</a>).
					</li>
					<li>
						No CSS parser here is a validity oracle, so the CSS sources keep invalid and
						out-of-scope inputs (wpt's deliberately invalid CSS, the preprocessor syntax in
						Prettier's <code>.css</code> fixtures): read a row's parsers against each other, not
						against 100%. tsv, a drop-in for Svelte's <code>parseCss</code>, sits above it on
						balance: it parses spec-valid CSS that <code>parseCss</code> rejects, and rejects a few
						malformed files <code>parseCss</code> lets through. CSS Syntax never rejects a
						stylesheet, so a spec-compliant parser would recover from those; tsv doesn't yet.
						PostCSS leads by not parsing selectors, at-rule preludes, or values, which admits
						preprocessor syntax, much of wpt's deliberately invalid CSS, and some valid modern CSS
						that tsv and <code>parseCss</code> both reject.
					</li>
					<li>
						yuku-parser's column is its wasm binding, since the native one segfaults on some of
						test262's escaped-identifier tests.

				{format_count(corpus_source_table.totals.files)} files from
				{corpus_source_table.rows.length} sources, all of them formatter, compiler, and conformance
				test suites. Each source links its upstream, at the commit the harness pinned where the
				report records one.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Svelte set is every <code>.svelte</code> and <code>.html</code> file, minus the
					harness's fixture exclusions and those svelte/compiler rejects. The <code>.html</code>
					files load as Svelte.
				</li>
				<li>
					test262 is its expected-valid tests outside <code>test/staging/</code>, minus the
					sloppy-mode tests under <code>test/annexB/</code>: Annex B is the web-browser layer,
					optional outside browsers, and tsv doesn't implement it. Over half the set is
					runtime-library tests (<code>built-ins</code>, <code>intl402</code>) with ordinary syntax.
				</li>
				<li>
					The TypeScript compiler's cases are the single-file <code>.ts</code> ones tsc's parser
					accepts and whose recorded baselines carry no grammar error.
				</li>
				<li>
					The web-platform-tests CSS is the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks of the
					<code>.html</code> pages under its <code>css/</code> directory, deduplicated.
				</li>
				<li>
					From Prettier's suites the harness drops range- and cursor-marker files, front-matter and
					multiparser fixtures, Babel-only proposals, error cases its specs expect every
					spec-grammar parser to reject, and the spec files themselves.
				</li>
				<li>
					JSX is excluded: Prettier's JSX suite, every <code>.tsx</code> file, and the
					<code>.js</code> fixtures Prettier reads as JSX are dropped, since every parser here is
					run in plain TypeScript mode, where all of them reject JSX. tsv has no JSX mode by design,
					so these tables don't measure that gap.
				</li>
				<li>
					TS/JS files parse as modules, with two exceptions: test262's parse as script or module, as
					each test's flags declare, and Prettier's JS and TypeScript fixtures take the goal their
					extension names (<code>.cjs</code>, <code>.mjs</code>, …), otherwise retrying as scripts
					when the module parse fails. <code>tsc</code> decides for itself.
