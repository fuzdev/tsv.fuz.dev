// The independent end-to-end CLI benchmark — a fork of Oxc's own
// `bench-formatter` that adds tsv (https://github.com/ryanatkn/oxc-bench-formatter,
// forked from https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-formatter — `tsv` is the fork's
// DEFAULT branch, so the bare fork URL already lands on it; upstream carries
// neither tsv nor this analysis). Unlike the in-process, single-threaded numbers
// elsewhere on this page, it measures the WHOLE CLI: process spawn, file
// discovery, I/O, and each tool's default multi-file parallelism. tsv, oxfmt, biome,
// and rsvelte-fmt parallelize across files while prettier formats them one at a time, so
// the wall-clock ratios scale with core count and are machine-dependent — the
// parallelism-neutral view is CPU work (hyperfine's `User` + `System` time). tsv runs only in
// the JSX-free scenarios (it has no JSX/TSX parser); the Svelte scenario benches
// it against rsvelte-fmt (`@rsvelte/fmt`), another Rust Svelte-native formatter,
// and the delivery scenario benches tsv against itself — the native binary, the
// same binary through `@fuzdev/tsv`'s Node dispatcher, and `@fuzdev/tsv-wasm`.
//
// The numbers come from `benchmarks_formatters.json`, generated from that
// harness's `results.json` by `benchmarks_formatters.gen.json.ts`; only the prose below
// is authored here. To refresh: run `pnpm run update-readme` in the harness, then
// `gro gen` here.
